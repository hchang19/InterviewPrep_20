# InterviewPrep_20
My Interview Preparation material
## Carey's PDF
Powerpoints created by Carey Nachenberg from CS32. Good for reviewing C++, ABT, Sorting, and many more. Do be aware of the scary
clown videos. You have been warned if you wish to use them. His most updated slides can also be found at

## Python
Code related to Python. It is my preferred language when it comes to interview as it easy to read and relatively light on the syntax compared to C++.
ONLY USE THIS LANGUAGE, AFTER YOU HAVE STUDIED THE C++ VERSION. 

## C++
Code related to C++. I do not use this coding language often in interview due to the heavy syntax. Currently my favorite language, due to the robust
and open hood style. Extremeley useful to understand important concepts such as memory allocation, freeing memory, pointers, and object oriented programming.

## NOTE
I study mainly from *Cracking the Coding Interview* by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. 

## list of problem sources?
Maybe one day I will start to keep track of where my problems come from, but for now, I just do them for improving my coding interview skill.
